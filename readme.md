![airbnb_admin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59934262-3bd6-425e-b4d5-b3246308b271)

This is a clone project of Airbnb's back-end, built with Python, Django, Django REST Framework.

## Technologies Used

- **Python & Django**: Chosen to quickly set up for user authentication, admin panel, and simplify the interactions with the SQL database.
- **Django REST Framework**: Chosen to create RESTful APIs.

## Features

- Django ORM
- Unit Testing
- User Management
- Admin Panel Customization

## Challenges & Future Improvements

### Challenges:

Initially, I did not know about Django's ORM. Once I discovered ORM features, the code became much cleaner, so that there was no need to create 5 bridge tables.

### Future Improvements:

- Implement a ReactJS front-end section for an interactive and dynamic web application.
